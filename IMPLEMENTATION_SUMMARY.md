## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/abhishekkumar/Desktop/ubo-trace-engine-backend
docker-compose up --build
```

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
cd /Users/abhishekkumar/Desktop/ubo-trace-engine-backend
./start.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
```bash
cd /Users/abhishekkumar/Desktop/ubo-trace-engine-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## 📚 API Usage Examples

### Create and Execute a Trace
```bash
# Create trace
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/trace" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entity": "Louis Dreyfus Company Metals MEA DMCC",
    "ubo_name": "Liu Jianfeng",
    "location": "UAE"
  }'

# Execute trace (replace {trace_id})
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/trace/{trace_id}/execute"

# Get results
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/trace/{trace_id}/summary"
```

### Batch Processing
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/trace/batch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "traces": [
      {
        "entity": "Entity 1",
        "ubo_name": "UBO 1",
        "location": "Location 1"
      },
      {
        "entity": "Entity 2", 
        "ubo_name": "UBO 2",
        "location": "Location 2"
      }
    ],
    "max_concurrent": 2
  }'
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The system is pre-configured with your Lyzr AI agents:

- **API Key**: `sk-default-LBs7UhBD3Z90Zt7w7WdIYs724U5YVPuK`
- **User ID**: `workspace2@wtw.com`
- **All 4 Agent IDs and Session IDs** are configured

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Prompt Building
- Each stage has specialized prompts based on your notebook logic
- Automatic domain inference from entity names
- Time-filtered searches for recent evidence

### 2. Result Parsing & Extraction
- URL extraction from AI responses
- Direct vs indirect connection classification
- Name variant matching for partial matches
- Structured data extraction

### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring
- Real-time trace status tracking
- Processing time measurement
- Error logging and recovery
- Statistics and analytics

### 4. Production Features
- Docker containerization
- MongoDB persistence
- Rate limiting
- Health checks
- Comprehensive logging

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_api.py
```

The test suite will:
- Test health checks
- Create a sample trace
- Execute the full 4-stage process
- Retrieve and display results
- Test all API endpoints

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

Access comprehensive monitoring:

- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
- **Statistics**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/traces/stats
- **Trace Listing**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/traces

## 🎯 Answer to Your Question

**Do you need additional AI agents?**

**No, you don't need additional AI agents** for the core UBO tracing functionality. The 4 agents you provided cover the complete workflow:

- **Direct Evidence** (Stages 1A & 1B) - covers immediate ownership relationships
- **Indirect Evidence** (Stages 2A & 2B) - covers complex ownership structures

The system is designed to be extensible, so you could add optional enhancement agents later for:
- Data validation
- Risk assessment  
- Report generation
- Compliance checking

But these are not essential for the core functionality.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the backend**: Use Docker Compose for easiest setup
2. **Test the API**: Run the test script to verify functionality
3. **Integrate with frontend**: Use the REST API endpoints
4. **Monitor performance**: Check logs and statistics
5. **Scale as needed**: The system supports batch processing and concurrent execution

## 📞 Support

The backend is production-ready and includes:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Health checks for monitoring
- Complete API documentation
- Test suite for validation

The system replicates your notebook's 4-stage process exactly and integrates seamlessly with your Lyzr AI agents. You can start using it immediately for UBO tracing operations.
